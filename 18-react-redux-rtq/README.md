**In Next.js, API Routes act like tiny backend functions where you write code to get, add, update, or delete data (like a waiter taking orders to the kitchen). RTK Query is like your smart front desk — it talks to those API Routes, handles the request, caches the data, and updates your UI automatically.** For example, imagine you're building a task manager: you create API routes in `app/api/tasks/route.js` to fetch and manage tasks from a database. Then, in your frontend, you use RTK Query to call those routes, so your app can show tasks, add new ones, and update them — all with auto-caching, loading states, and refetching handled for you.

Let me know if you want a code flow of that setup!
